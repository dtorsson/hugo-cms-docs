```go
{{</* note title="Note" */>}}
Nothing to see here, move along.
{{</* /note */>}}
```

This will print the following block:

{{< note title="Note" >}}
Nothing to see here, move along.
{{< /note >}}

The shortcode adds a neutral color for the note class and a red color for the warning class. You can also add a custom title:

```go
{{</* warning title="Don't try this at home" */>}}
Nothing to see here, move along.
{{</* /warning */>}}
```

This will print the following block:

{{< warning title="Don't try this at home" >}}
Nothing to see here, move along.
{{< /warning >}}
