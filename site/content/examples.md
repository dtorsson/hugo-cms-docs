## Logotype system

Forza Football doesn’t have one logotype only. We are using several patterns and colors to represent football as it looks today. This is a way of showing that Forza Football isn’t only a company, we represent a whole world.  

**Our logotype system contains 27 logotypes in 3 different categories, with 9 of each cateogry. Read about the categories below.**

**1 Primary/standard logo**  

Neon green stripe (2-color). This will be used everywhere. And when we can't use the gif, we will always use this one. On social media, in print and as a starter of every gif we have.

**2-color logotypes**

This is the logotype-system we use as often as we can; in our apps (if possible), on our website, in presentations etc. Basically, on all units as much as it is possible, we should use the 2-color system.

**3-color logotype system:**

These are our so-called "bonus logotypes" or "luxury logotypes. On special occasions, we will use these. Maybe when showing something for our brand or when we have released something big, when making global polls etc.

**Graphics logotype system (with and without the text Forza Football):**

These will be used as a support to the brand. We do not use this digitally. 

We have graphics both with and without the Forza Football text on them. 

The ones without the text inside the logo exist for the possibility to build patterns, also mostly for merch like scarfs, socks an on our company car etc. The ones with the text inside the logo are for merc

Graphics (without text), with the text Forza Football under the graphics: 

merch purpose only
This is to be used on merch sold to the outside world or giveaways. This will make it feel less like a logotype. Only employees will wear our “regular” logo on merch.

## Placement

We need to adapt the placement to each unit. On presentations it should always be places in the top left corner.

## Colors

We have 16 different colors to play with.

## Font

We use the font New Rail. Why? Because it looks nice and gives good readability on a small space compared to other fonts.
